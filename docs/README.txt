This directory contains the auto-generated documentation for
standoff-mode.  See http://lueck.github.io/standoff-mode

The files in the `en` and `de` sub-directories are generated from
`standoff-en.texi` and `standoff-de.texi` in the root folder.

Do not manually change the contents of theses directories, but the
texi files. Use

	make html

to generate the docs.

Update:
The docs now should be generated with github actions...
