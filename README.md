See the [documentation for
standoff-mode](http://lueck.github.io/standoff-mode) in HTML.

If you see this in the [gh-pages
branch](https://github.com/lueck/standoff-mode/tree/gh-pages), you see
the documentation that was auto-generated with github actions.

The files in the `en` and `de` sub-directories are generated from
`standoff-en.texi` and `standoff-de.texi` in the master branch's root
folder.

Do not manually change the contents of the `gh-pages` branch!

To generate the HTML documentation locally, run

```
make html
```
